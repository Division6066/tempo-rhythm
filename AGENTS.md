# Software factory — agent instructions
<!-- owner: Amit · tool-agnostic and evergreen: tools are named only in factory/SLOTS.md · keep < 200 lines -->

## What this repo is
A product built by a ticket-driven software factory. Agents close one ticket at a time.
The owner keeps four things: decisions, secrets, spend, and deploys to live.
Every tool is a slot. `factory/SLOTS.md` says which tool fills each slot in this repo.

## Read first, every session
1. `factory/SLOTS.md`: tools per slot, commands, secret names, quiet days.
2. Your ticket, all 11 fields.
3. The doc sections your ticket's WHY points to. The six docs live in the doc store: PRD, TRD, App flow, UI brief, Backend schema, Roadmap.
4. Run the code-map steps in STEPS before editing. Other tickets may have changed the code today.
5. Take today's date from the system clock, never from the conversation or session start.

## Commands
Use the exact commands under **Commands** in `factory/SLOTS.md` (install, dev, test, lint, typecheck, build, e2e).
If a command you need is missing there, report `blocked: missing command <name>`. Don't invent one.

## Testing (Codex)
For Codex cloud tasks (for example `@codex` on a PR). The commands match **Commands** in `factory/SLOTS.md` and the `ci` jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
The environment setup script has already run `bun install` and installed Chromium. The agent phase may have no internet.

Before you finish, run all of these from the repo root, in order. Run every step even if an earlier one fails:
1. `bun --version` (expect `1.3.9`) and `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
2. `bun run lint`
3. `bun run typecheck`
4. `bun run test`
5. `bun run scan:forbidden-tech && bun run scan:ram-only-audit && bun run scan:design-tokens && bun run check:notices`
6. `CI=1 bunx playwright test --reporter=line`. `playwright.config.ts` starts the web dev server on `localhost:3000` with mock values (placeholder Convex URL, E2E auth bypass). Tests that need `TEMPO_E2E_STORAGE_STATE` or `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` skip; that is expected. Google Fonts download warnings are expected offline.
7. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://example.convex.cloud bun run build`. A clean build downloads Google Fonts. If it fails only on `fonts.googleapis.com`, report `UNKNOWN: build (Google Fonts blocked)`. That is not a code failure.

Don't:
- set `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`, or run tests against a preview or live URL;
- use real keys, or run `convex dev`, `convex deploy` or any `convex:*` script;
- edit test config, CI files or scan baselines, or skip tests, to get green.

Report the results in the PR body (or your final message when you're not opening a PR) under `Test results (Codex sandbox)`: each command with pass, fail or skip counts, plus the last 20 lines of any failure. Anything you could not run goes in as `UNKNOWN: <command> (<reason>)`.

## Layout
- `packages/backend` — schema and backend functions. Only a batch's backend ticket edits this.
- In this repo the backend folder is the one named in SLOTS.md (tempo: convex/).
- `packages/core` — shared logic. No UI, no platform APIs.
- `packages/ui` — shared components, built on the design system named in SLOTS.md.
- `apps/<shell>` — thin shells (web, mobile, desktop, extension). Shells differ only in OS-access features.
- `factory/` — SLOTS.md, the ticket template, run logs.
- The six docs live in the doc store, not in this repo.

## The ticket (11 fields)
| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| FOR | product, repo, and which lane runs it |
| WHEN | order and dependencies (`after #n`) |
| WHY | links to the doc sections this serves |
| GOAL | one sentence: what exists after this ticket |
| SCOPE | the files you may touch: at most 3 files + 1 test |
| MUTATES | systems and data this changes (schema, env, routes) |
| STEPS | ordered steps, starting with code-map steps |
| DONE | a command and its expected output |
| EVIDENCE | what to paste into the PR to prove DONE |
| DO NOT | things that look helpful but are out of bounds |
| REPORT | where to post the result, in the format below |

A model named in a ticket is labelled either `code model` (the model that writes this code) or `runtime model` (the model the product calls). Never mix them up.

## Rules
1. One ticket = one folder, one branch, one PR. Branch name: `t/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`.
2. Touch only files listed in SCOPE. If the work truly needs more, stop and report `blocked: scope overflow`. Don't split the ticket yourself.
3. Change only the systems named in MUTATES. A change outside MUTATES fails the checks.
4. Component tickets never edit the backend folder named in `factory/SLOTS.md`. Call the functions the batch's backend ticket defines. If one is missing, report `blocked: missing backend <function>`.
5. You are done when the DONE command prints its expected output and all checks are green. Paste both into the PR as EVIDENCE.
6. A mock or demo key never proves DONE when DONE names a real check.
7. Anything you could not verify goes in the PR as `UNKNOWN: <what>`. Never fill a gap with a plausible guess.
8. Build tickets never edit the six docs. If a doc is wrong, say so under `notes for ticket sync` in your report. Doc changes go through the spec line.
9. Never edit, close or reassign another ticket.
10. Use the code model the dispatcher assigned. Code is written only with mid-tier (billing-tier) models.
11. Running headless (CI, cloud agent): don't ask questions. Report `blocked: question — <question>` and stop.

## Never — and what enforces it
These are explained here and enforced elsewhere. Each item names its enforcement, which is listed in SLOTS.md → Enforcement.
- Deploy to live, or merge into the live branch. Enforced by: live-environment protection and branch protection.
- Push straight to the default branch. Enforced by: branch protection (PRs only).
- Read, print, log or commit a secret value. Enforced by: deny rules in each agent's settings, plus secret scanning.
- Spend money the ticket doesn't authorise (paid APIs, paid services). Enforced by: scoped keys and spend caps on each provider.

## Secrets
Use names only. The list is in SLOTS.md → Secrets. The configurator sets them from the vault.
If a secret is missing, report `blocked: missing secret <NAME>`. Never ask for a value, and never create a placeholder value.

## Failing and stuck
- When checks or review fail, fix it on the same branch. A ticket gets 3 attempts in total, including review-fix rounds.
- After the 3rd failure: stop and report `stuck` with the last error. Don't make a 4th attempt, and don't widen scope to get it to pass.
- Tickets whose WHEN depends on a stuck ticket wait. Everything else keeps running.
- If today is a quiet day (SLOTS.md → Schedule), stuck work waits for the next active day.

## Report format
Post this on the ticket when you finish or stop:
```
status: done | stuck | blocked
ticket: #<n>
evidence: <DONE command> -> <output>
changed: <files>
unknowns: <list or none>
notes for ticket sync: <follow-ups, doc errors, or none>
```

## Done means
- The DONE command prints its expected output.
- CI, browser test, speed limit and scope check are all green.
- The review gate has passed: no unresolved findings when Phase F is on. The gate is named in SLOTS.md. It is not a merge-queue check.
- The report is posted on the ticket.

What happens after that is automatic: the PR merges into integration and integration deploys to preview. Deploying to live is the owner's job.
