## HARD_RULES compliance checklist

Read @docs/HARD_RULES.md before ticking. Unchecked boxes must have a note.

- [ ] No forbidden tech added (§2): no Firebase, Supabase, Prisma/Drizzle, Clerk/Auth0/NextAuth, direct OpenAI/Anthropic/Google AI SDKs, Redux/Zustand/Jotai, Axios.
- [ ] AI-originated state changes surface an accept / edit / reject card with preview (§1, §6).
- [ ] Schema changes respect `v.*` validators, indexes, soft-delete, and RAM-only fields (§5).
- [ ] Styling uses design tokens from `packages/ui` — no ad-hoc hex or rogue Tailwind utilities (§7).
- [ ] Accessibility: keyboard nav, focus-visible, `prefers-reduced-motion`, color contrast (§8).
- [ ] No secrets committed; new env vars documented in `.env.example` with a one-line comment (§13).
- [ ] Voice rules honored — never shame the user; empty states are kind (§1, §9).

## Owner tag (§14)

<!-- Pick exactly one. This tells reviewers who is allowed to act on this PR.
     Code agents must only submit PRs under their own tag. -->

- [ ] `cursor-ide`
- [ ] `cursor-cloud-1`
- [ ] `cursor-cloud-2`
- [ ] `cursor-cloud-3`
- [ ] `twin`
- [ ] `pokee`
- [ ] `zo`
- [ ] `human-amit`

## Reviewer

<!-- Default: Amit (human-amit). For code-agent PRs, a second agent may be tagged
     with `reviewer` after human approval. Code agents never merge their own PRs. -->
